Graph 1 gives a visual representation of the number of parent categories where successful, failed, live, and canceled. 
* Music and Theater had the highest number of successes.
* Film & Video were the third most successful. 
* Food and Games had the highest number of failures. 
* Journalism was canceled every time.

Graph 2 gives a visual representation of the number of successful, failed, live, and canceled parent categories per month. 
* Of successful shows, the majority were done between May and June. 
* Of failed shows, the majority were in July and October. 
* Of canceled shows, the majority were in July and November. 
* Of live shows, all took place between January through March, with the majority being in March. 
* More shows failed than succeeded in Decemeber.

## Recommendations:
#### The best time to run a show would be between May and June as it is the most likely to be successful during those months based on the data. I would not recommended running your show in the month of Decemeber as it is the leastly to be successful during that month. When choosing your category of show, Music will be the most likely to be successful, followed by Theater, and then Film & Video. I do not recommend Journalism. Technology is also a risky chose as it is more likely to fail or be canceled than be successful.

# Kickstarter Challenge 
## Overview
Contains an analysis of Kickstart Data using Excel to uncover new trends, including visuals to easily represent outcomes.

## Analysis and Challenges
### To preform analysis: Pivot tables, Pivot charts, Filters, Statistical Data and Box and Wisker charts were used to find trends in the data set. 
Challenges arose when creating countif statements, but after figuring out the formula the rest of the set became easier to understand. Using a Pivot table to arrange 
the ranges of Outcome Based on Goals, I ran into a problem with the automatic format used by excel when trying to put each goal set in numerical order. I tried using 
many different number formats but still could not get it to work. I finally just had to add a zero in the front of numbers less than 5-digits. I do feel like there is 
a way around this, but I could not finure it out. As far as pivot charts, they were challenging but after messing around with columns and rows, I was able to reach my 
desired outcome. See the following visuals:

## Results
* Two conclusions drawn from the Theater Outcomes by Launch Date were that statistically, the best time to produce a theater show would be between 
May and June and that December would be a risky month to have a show as it is just as likely to be successful as it is to fail. 
* From Outcomes Based on Goals, I can conclude that no plays were canceled. When the goal is between 0 and 4999, the show is most likely going to be successful. 
When the goal is between 45000 and 49999, then it failed 100% of the time. It is best to have a goal range between 0 and 4999 for a play. 
* There are some limitations in the datasets. Not all types of shows are being displayed, you will have to reference multiple graphs and data sets to get a 
clear idea of what shows work best and when. As well as their success rates and more. 
* We could create a table based on the shows outcome and the spotlight. It would give an idea of weather of not a show is successful based on the attention 
that it was given. Another table could be greated on the date started versus when it ended, giving information on if the length the show ran for was an 
indication of anything important. This could be ran against outcomes or category.
