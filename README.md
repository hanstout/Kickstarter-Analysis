## Recommendations:
#### The best time to run a show would be between May and June as it is the most likely to be successful during those months based on the data. I would not recommended running your show in the month of Decemeber as it is the leastly to be successful during that month. When choosing your category of show, Music will be the most likely to be successful, followed by Theater, and then Film & Video. I do not recommend Journalism. Technology is also a risky chose as it is more likely to fail or be canceled than be successful.
