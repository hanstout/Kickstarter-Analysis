## Analysis and Challenges
To preform analysis: Pivot tables, Pivot charts, Filters, Statistical Data and Box and Wisker charts were used to find trends in the data set. 
Challenges arose when creating countif statements, but after figuring out the formula the rest of the set became easier to understand. Using a 
Pivot table to arrange the ranges of Outcome Based on Goals, I ran into a problem with the automatic format used by excel when trying to put each 
goal set in numerical order. I tried using many different number formats but still could not get it to work. I finally just had to add a zero in 
the front of numbers less than 5-digits. I do feel like there is a way around this, but I could not finure it out. As far as pivot charts, they were
challenging but after messing around with columns and rows, I was able to reach my desired outcome.

## Results
* Two conclusions drawn from the Theater Outcomes by Launch Date were that statistically, the best time to produce a theater show would be between 
May and June and that December would be a risky month to have a show as it is just as likely to be successful as it is to fail. 
* From Outcomes Based on Goals, I can conclude that no plays were canceled. When the goal is between 0 and 4999, the show is most likely going to be successful. 
When the goal is between 45000 and 49999, then it failed 100% of the time. It is best to have a goal range between 0 and 4999 for a play. 
* There are some limitations in the datasets. Not all types of shows are being displayed, you will have to reference multiple graphs and data sets to get a 
clear idea of what shows work best and when. As well as their success rates and more. 
* We could create a table based on the shows outcome and the spotlight. It would give an idea of weather of not a show is successful based on the attention 
that it was given. Another table could be greated on the date started versus when it ended, giving information on if the length the show ran for was an 
indication of anything important. This could be ran against outcomes or category.
